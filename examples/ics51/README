Note that we are using CPP files, so we need to change the file extensions of all the submissions.  Also note that the scripts expect each submission to exactly follow the format 'ucinetid.cpp', so you'll need to cut off any other characters, i.e. 'ucinetid_lab2.cpp' or 'ucinetid_studentID#_lab2.cpp'.  This is easy to accomplish with the 'filename_replace.py' script I have in my 'scripts' git repository in the python folder, though you may need something more powerful (or just do it by hand) to get rid of student ID #s or other miscellaneous stuff they added to the file names.

Once we generate the output files for each submission, we should concatenate them together to create a .csv file for importing to the EEE gradebook, spreadsheet, or whatever you're using to submit grades.
