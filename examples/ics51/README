Note that we are using CPP files, so we need to change the file extensions of all the submissions.  This is easy to accomplish with the 'filename_replace.py' script I have in my 'scripts' git repository in the python folder.

Once we generate the output files for each submission, we should concatenate them together to create a .csv file for importing to the EEE gradebook, spreadsheet, or whatever you're using to submit grades.
