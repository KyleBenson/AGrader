EXAMPLES

The examples expect the following directories to be present:

 - submissions : contains files named as 'ucinetid.java' that represent submissions from students.  Note that they may be stored in folders named like [a|b|c|d] to represent different portions of each assignment, as created by Checkmate when students submit through it

I didn't include actual example submissions from students for fairly obvious reasons...
